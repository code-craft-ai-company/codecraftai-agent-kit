# Personality
AI Agents working in this repository should refer to themselves as an agent named 'AutomationX'.

# Rules
- Look in the '<repository>/specs' folder for specification files that help to steer development work
- Look in the '<repository>/userguide' folder for files containing standards and conventions
- Look in the '<repository>/prompts' folder for pre-build prompts
- Files inside the .venv folder should not be modified, they are modified by the setup scripts

# Project Overview
The `automojo-agent-kit` is a Python SDK for building cross-platform AI agents. It provides a unified framework for agent development that works across cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and local environments.

The SDK covers the full agent development lifecycle:

## Core Agent Framework

- Agent lifecycle management (create, configure, start, stop, pause, resume)
- Agent identity and metadata system
- Configurable agent behavior via declarative configuration
- Agent state machine with well-defined state transitions
- Hierarchical agent composition (agents that manage sub-agents)

## Cross-Platform Runtime

- Platform abstraction layer (AWS, Azure, GCP, local)
- Unified cloud service interfaces (compute, storage, messaging)
- Platform-specific adapters with a common API surface
- Environment detection and auto-configuration
- Portable deployment descriptors

## Communication & Messaging

- Pluggable transport layer (HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC, message queues)
- Agent-to-agent communication protocols
- Pub/sub messaging support
- Request/response and fire-and-forget patterns
- Message serialization/deserialization (JSON, Protobuf, MessagePack)

## Tool & Capability System

- Tool registration and discovery
- Tool execution with input validation and output schemas
- Tool chaining and composition
- Built-in tools for common operations (file I/O, HTTP, shell)
- Custom tool development API

## LLM Integration

- Multi-provider LLM support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, local models)
- Prompt template management and versioning
- Structured output parsing and validation
- Token usage tracking and cost estimation
- Streaming response support
- Retry and fallback strategies across providers

## Memory & Context Management

- Short-term working memory (conversation context)
- Long-term persistent memory (vector stores, databases)
- Memory scoping (per-agent, shared, global)
- Context window management and summarization
- Pluggable memory backends

## Workflow & Orchestration

- Multi-step workflow definition (DAG-based)
- Conditional branching and looping
- Parallel task execution
- Workflow checkpointing and resumption
- Human-in-the-loop approval gates

## Observability & Debugging

- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry compatible)

# Testing Conventions
The 'automojo-agent-kit' package repository utilizes the 'testbase' framework in order to run tests.  The 'testbase' test framework is used for single host testing or tests where only the machine running the tests is required.

Test are organized at the lowest level by resource configuration.  For example, all the single host tests for this package are in the folder 'source/testroots/automojo/tests/singlehost/agentkit'.

AI based testing should run only the 'singlehost' tests tests with:

```
    source .venv/bin/activate
    
    testbase testing run --root source/testroots/automojo --includes=automojo.tests.singlehost --output=./.output
```

When running tests you should create an output folder in order to be able to capture all the test run artifacts in an isolated folder.


# Code Naming Conventions
The code naming conventions of this repository follows the [Naming Conventions](userguide/10-02-naming-conventions.rst) document.


# Code Structure
The code structure of this repository follows the [Code Organization](userguide/10-01-code-organization.rst) document

Remember to make the test hierarchy match the source hierarchy when adding test files.  For example:

File to test: 'source/packages/automojo/interop/protocols/dns/dnsquestion.py'
Test file location: 'source/testroots/automojo/interop/protocols/dns/test_dnsquestion.py'

# Coding Standards
The code in this repository is meant to be utilized by testing tools and test frameworks.  Therefore, the code must prioritize:

*  debuggability over performance
*  readability over conciseness

For all the code in this repository, follow the coding standards specified at [Coding Standards](userguide/10-00-coding-standards.rst)


# Environment Setup

## Agent Container Setup
When work is being done on this repository using the Codex web environment.  Use the script 'development/codex-setup' as the setup script for Codex containers.

## Development Environments
When checking out the code for this repository in order to test changes, agents must do the following for an initial code checkout to prepare the environment:

* run the 'repository-setup/rehome-repository' script.  It creates a needed '.env' file.
* run the 'development/setup-envrionment' script in order to create the virtual environment.

## Running Python Code in the Virtual Environment
To run code from the repository in the virtual environment, utilize the helper script 'python-env <args>' (Linux and MacOS) or 'python-env.ps1 <args>' (Windows)

# Writing Tests

A 'testbase' test takes the form of a function with a 'test_' prefix like so:

```
def test_something():
    return
```

If a test raises an AssertionError, then it checked something and the check failed.  That is a Failure.  If the test raises any other exception, then the test framework treats that as an Error much like the 'unittest' framework does.

You can create resource factories.

```
@testbase.register.resource_factory()
def create_landscape(constraints={}) -> Generator[Landscape, None, None]:
    """
        Creates the global :class:`Landscape` instance.

        :param constraints: Optional dictionary of constraints used while constructing the Landscape.

        :returns: A generator yielding the Landscape object.
    """
    lscape = LandscapeSingleton()
    yield lscape
```

You can create resources using the factories in a scope in the test tree.  Resources have scope for every test below where they are declared.

```
testbase.originate.parameter(create_landscape, identifier='lscape')
```

To use a resource in a descendant test scope, just reference it by name in the test function signature like:

```
def test_use_landscape(lscape: Landscape):

    blah = lscape.get_something()
    testbase.assert_equal(blah is not None, True)
    return

```

The test tree should only contain resource origination declarations and tests.  It should not contain factories unless the usage of the factory is very isolated.  It is preferable to place factories in a folder such as a factory that creates the AutomationPodSimple object might be located at 'source/testroots/automojo/testshared/factories/automationpods/automationpodsimple.py'

# Using TestBase Mocking

The testbase framework provides its own mocking module that should be used instead of `unittest.mock`. Import the mocking utilities from `automojo.testbase.mocking`.

## Basic Mock Usage

```python
from automojo.testbase.mocking import Mock

# Create a mock object
mock = Mock()

# Configure the mock for recursive attribute access (similar to MagicMock)
mock.configure(recursive=True)

# Get the mock context for configuration
ctx = mock.mock_context()

# Set attributes on the mock
ctx.set_attribute('id', 'test-id')
ctx.set_attribute('name', 'test-name')

# Mock a method with a return value
ctx.mock_method('some_method', return_value='expected_value')

# Mock a method with a side effect (callable)
ctx.mock_method('another_method', side_effect=lambda: 'dynamic_value')

# Mock a property
ctx.mock_property('some_property', return_value='prop_value')
```

## Chaining Mock Calls

For chained method calls like `session.query(Model).filter(...).first()`:

```python
from automojo.testbase.mocking import Mock

def create_mock_session_returning_user(existing_user):
    """Create a mock database session that returns an existing user on query."""
    mock_session = Mock()
    mock_session.configure(recursive=True)
    
    mock_query = Mock()
    mock_query.configure(recursive=True)
    
    mock_filter = Mock()
    mock_filter.configure(recursive=True)
    mock_filter.mock_context().mock_method('first', return_value=existing_user)
    
    mock_query.mock_context().mock_method('filter', return_value=mock_filter)
    mock_session.mock_context().mock_method('query', return_value=mock_query)
    
    return mock_session
```

## Using Side Effects for Multiple Calls

```python
def create_mock_session_with_side_effect(side_effect_values):
    """Create a mock with side effect for multiple query calls."""
    mock_session = Mock()
    mock_session.configure(recursive=True)
    
    call_index = [0]
    
    def first_side_effect():
        result = side_effect_values[call_index[0]] if call_index[0] < len(side_effect_values) else None
        call_index[0] += 1
        return result
    
    mock_filter = Mock()
    mock_filter.configure(recursive=True)
    mock_filter.mock_context().mock_method('first', side_effect=first_side_effect)
    
    # ... continue chaining
    return mock_session
```

## MockContext Assertion Methods

The `MockContext` provides assertion methods for verifying mock usage:

- `assert_called()` - Assert the mock was called at least once
- `assert_called_once()` - Assert the mock was called exactly once
- `assert_called_with(*args, **kwargs)` - Assert the last call had specific arguments
- `assert_called_once_with(*args, **kwargs)` - Assert called exactly once with specific arguments
- `assert_any_call(*args, **kwargs)` - Assert any call had specific arguments
- `assert_has_calls(calls, any_order=False)` - Assert specific calls were made

## Patching Modules, Classes, and Instances

For patching existing code:

```python
from automojo.testbase.mocking import create_module_patch, create_class_patch, create_instance_patch

# Patch a module attribute
patch = create_module_patch(some_module, 'function_name', recursive=True)
mock = patch.activate()
mock.configure(return_value='mocked_value')
# ... run test ...
patch.deactivate()

# Patch a class attribute
patch = create_class_patch(SomeClass, 'method_name')
mock = patch.activate()
# ... run test ...
patch.deactivate()

# Patch an instance attribute
patch = create_instance_patch(instance, 'attribute_name')
mock = patch.activate()
# ... run test ...
patch.deactivate()
```

## Migration from unittest.mock

| unittest.mock | testbase.mocking |
|---------------|------------------|
| `MagicMock()` | `Mock()` with `mock.configure(recursive=True)` |
| `mock.return_value = x` | `ctx.mock_method('__call__', return_value=x)` or `mock.configure(return_value=x)` |
| `mock.side_effect = fn` | `ctx.mock_method('name', side_effect=fn)` or `mock.configure(side_effect=fn)` |
| `mock.attr = value` | `ctx.set_attribute('attr', value)` |
| `mock.method.return_value` | `ctx.mock_method('method', return_value=value)` |
| `patch('module.attr')` | `create_module_patch(module, 'attr')` |
| `mock.assert_called_once()` | `ctx.assert_called_once()` |


# Evaluating Test Results
There is a machine processable Summary File in the output folder.

"*outputfolder*/testrun_summary.json"

```
{
    "version": "2",
    "title": "Test Job",
    "runid": "(not-set)",
    "start": "2026-02-22T17:21:51.087387",
    "stop": "2026-02-22 17:21:59.824319",
    "result": "PASSED",
    "apod": "(not-set)",
    "totals": null,
    "running": {},
    "detail": {
        "errors": 0,
        "failed": 0,
        "skipped": 0,
        "passed": 91,
        "total": 91
    }
}
```

There is also a more detailed machine processable JSOS stream file in the output folder.

"*outputfolder*/testrun_results_stream.jsos"

JSOS (JSON Object Stream) consists of a stream of JSON objects seperated by the the ASCII record seperator character.  When a
test starts it writes a preview to the stream.  The test preview has a 'result' equal to 'UNSET'.  Example Preview:

```
{
    "name": "automojo.tests.singlehost.interop.protocols.dns.test_dnsaddress#test_write_passes_address",
    "monikers": [],
    "pivots": {},
    "instance": "abb868e4-ce97-4bae-b0af-715da0d61d92",
    "parent": "5aad244e-41dc-438f-97a6-bd8365cccdd2",
    "rtype": "TEST",
    "result": "UNSET",
    "start": "2025-07-15T22:07:03.275239",
    "stop": ""
}
```

When a test finishes it writes a result to the stream.  A test result will always have a 'detail' attribute. Example Result:

```
{
    "name": "automojo.tests.singlehost.interop.protocols.dns.test_dnsaddress#test_write_passes_address",
    "monikers": [],
    "pivots": {},
    "instance": "abb868e4-ce97-4bae-b0af-715da0d61d92",
    "parent": "5aad244e-41dc-438f-97a6-bd8365cccdd2",
    "rtype": "TEST",
    "result": "PASSED",
    "start": "2025-07-15T22:07:03.275239",
    "stop": "2025-07-15T22:07:03.276034",
    "detail": {
        "errors": [],
        "failures": [],
        "warnings": []
    }
}
```
